        <h1>How Singing and Songwriting helped change my life.</h1>
        
    
        <p>Singing has been my passion since I was 2 years old. I loved listening to artists like Beyonce, Rihanna, Ciara, etc. I always imagined myself being on stage performing in front of thousands of people and singing songs that were created. When I was 7, I moved to California to pursue my first singing career and lived there for 6 years. During my time in California, I created a song and a music video. I met amazing people there and I performed my song on stage in front of people. Eventually, when I turn 13 I moved to Illinois and then back to Michigan after living there for 2 years.  Even though I moved back to Michigan in 2018, I still wanted to go back and pursue Singing again. I’m passionate about singing because singing makes me feel connected to myself. It makes me feel whole and completed along with songwriting. I started songwriting when I was suffering from some mental health issue and songwriting was therapeutic to me. I would write about my feeling from the perspective of a heartbroken girl.	 When I started writing, I took inspiration from artists like Harry Styles, Frank Ocean, Billie Eilish, and other artists similar to them. I love writing stories and making up stories in my songs because I feel that it brings them to life. </p>
        <p>I think that singing and songwriting are like a painting and creating a masterpiece when you put your heart into it. It is a way to express yourself when you are not good at talking. Singing and songwriting helped me get through so much when I felt my lowest and I always felt better after writing a song. Singing is such a huge part of life and has been for a long time. Singing runs in my family. On my mom’s side, my grandfather and my aunts sing as well. One day I hope to share my passion with the world and help inspire people who feel the same way that I do. I hope to me an inspiration to people who want to sing and song write</p>
