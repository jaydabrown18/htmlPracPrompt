        <p>Singing has been my passion since I was 2 years old. I loved listening to artist like Beyonce, Rihanna, Ciara, etc. I alway imagined myself being on stage performing in front of thousands of people and singing songs that were created. When I was 7, I moved to California to pursue my first singing career and lived there for 6 years. Even though I moved back to Michigan in 2018, I still wanted to go back and pursue Singing again. Iâ€™m passionate about singing because singing makes me feel connected to myself. It makes me feel whole and completed along with songwriting. I started songwriting when I was suffering from some mental health issue and songwrtiting was theraputic to me. I would write about my feeling in the perspective of a heartbroken girl.</p>
        <p> I think that singing and songwriting are like a painting and creating a masterpiece when you put your heart into it. It is a way to express yourself when you are not good at talking. Singing and songwriting helped me get through so much when I felt my lowest and I always felt better after writing a song. One day I hope to share my passion with the world and help inspire people who feel the same way that I do.</p>
